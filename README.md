# Hi! I'm Yimei 👋

I will graduate from Carnegie Mellon University on this May. My background bridges applied AI research and full-stack system development. I’ve worked on model fine-tuning, multimodal architectures, generative models, GPU-accelerated computation, and deploying scalable ML infrastructure on the cloud.

### 🔬 Recent Highlights

- 🎵 Developed a modular **video-to-music generation framework** aligning audio with visual transitions using CLIP-based semantic & temporal features, VAE latent encoding, and Transformer-based diffusion with ongoing LLM-guided music prompt conditioning for enhanced coherence.
- 🧠 Fine-tuned **GPT-2 with LoRA** to enhance **FLARE multi-hop reasoning** in a medical **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system.
- ☁️ Deployed cloud-native **microservices and CI/CD pipelines** on GKE with automated analysis and Hadoop integration.
- ⚙️ Built the Needle deep learning framework from scratch, supporting automatic differentiation and **CUDA-accelerated sparse-dense matrix multiplication** to speed up GNN training.
- 🛡️ **Fine-tuned YOLOv8** for image classification and implemented **FGSM-based adversarial attacks** to evaluate model robustness.
